Description: Uplift modeling aims at predicting the causal effect of an action such as a marketing campaign on a particular individual. In order to simplify the task for practitioners in uplift modeling, we propose a combination of tools that can be separated into the following ingredients: i) quantization, ii) visualization, iii) variable selection, iv) parameters estimation and, v) model validation.
